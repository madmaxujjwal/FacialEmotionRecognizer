# FacialEmotionRecognizer


It is a web flask application which takes live video feed through a computer's webcam and gives emotions(sad, happy, neutral, disgust, anger, suprise, fear) of human faces present.


-->The code uses Python language only.

-->It uses convolutional neural network algorithm as deep learning model.

-->It uses python libraries like numpy, tensorflow, opencv, flask, etc.

-->It uses flask to deploy the application in web.

-->Its accuracy is 67%.

-->It uses softmax and relu as activation function and uses batchnormalization and dropout to eliminate hyperfitting.

-->It uses opencv to take images from live video and converts it into gray, 48X48 pixels format to feed into the model to make predictions.
